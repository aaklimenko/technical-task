# Amadeus It Group PHP Developer Technical Task. Alex Klimenko

## Overview

Initial task was pretty trivial, so I decided to add some complexity to it :)

The legend: a person goes to the zoo and sends SMS messages to his/her spouse about
everything he/she observes there. The zoo has a golf car that drives visitors to
all animals. Animals cannot "send messages", only display their behaviour. A visitor
observes behaviors displayed by animals and sends everything using SMS (stdOut).
Also a visitor chooses to interact with each animal, so there's a change of
being bited to it. After every interaction a visitor sends his mood status.
